# CTF Write-ups
The goal of this repository is to keep track of our participations in online and physical CTFs. By doing a write-up, you will help security newcomers to get engaged in our community.

## Guidelines
- Contribute by submiting PRs.
- Consider wording your write-up in a way that is accessible to all your fellow JDIs.
- Don't be shy to present your solutions!
- If you find a mistake, consider submiting a PR to fix it.
- If you are doing a live CTF, consider waiting for the end before submiting your PRs (take notes though!).
- Each event/CTF should have its own folder.
- Please add a README.md in every new folder to give at least a minimal description of the event.
